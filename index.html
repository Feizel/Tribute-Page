      <br>
      <p>Professor Osbourne was born is 1914 in the small town of Cresco, Iowa. During his young years, he gained a keen
        interest in computers & how they work. At the time, computers where extremely primitive, allowing for simple
        analog algorithms which achieved simple tasks, nothing revolutionary.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>After graduating high school in 1932, Professor Osbourne left his family's farm to attend university in
        Minnesota. This was achived throght the aid of the National Youth Administration, which was a Depression era
        program. In 1935, he had to take a hiatus from his studies in order to save up while working for the Civilian
        Conservation Corps helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars
        on me.".
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Professor Osbourne finished university in 1937, then took up a job post in the US Forestry Service. He got
        married in 1938 to wife of 69 years, Margret Gibson, got laid off due to budget cuts, and spent this time being
        Inspired by Alan Turing, before he returning to school to study under Stakman, who teaches him all about
        computers
        and to program them. He tried to enlist for the army in 1941 but was rejected; Instead offerd to work on a
        code-breaking machine, securing telecommunication lines, and applied science.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>He received his Ph.D in 1942 in Electronics & Engineering. He rejects a 100% salary increase
        from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new computer engineering program.
        Over
        the next 16 years, his team makes major breakthroughs in computer architecture, programming language syntax,
        encryption-breaking algorithms - including foundational work on data structure.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Professor Osbourne was a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University, He died at the age of 95 in 2009,
        leaving in his wake a life well-lived serving humanity with his brilliant brain, an astounding academic career,
        and numerous papers, which have been studied extensively, peer-reviewed and cited in more than 500+ papers. He
        is a well respected fellow who's contributions will help generations to come.

        <li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired
          by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him all about computers
          and to program them.</li>
        <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected.
          Instead, the military asked his lab to work on a code-breaking machine, securing telecommunication lines, and
          applied science.</li>
        <li><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Electronics & Engineering</li>
        <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase
          from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new computer engineering program.
          Over
          the next 16 years, his team makes major breakthroughs in computer architecture, programming language syntax,
          encryption-breaking algorithms - including foundational work on data structure.</li>
        <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to decrypt encryped messages from enemy forces, leading to major
          victory on strategic points.</li>
        <li><strong>1953</strong> - explores the nature of data structurs, begins work on setting rules to be applied to
          sorting algorithms while collaborating with his mentor, Turing.</li>
        <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian
          subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>
        <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
        <li><strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields

        <li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that
          genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM
          crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long
          time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
        <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
        <li><strong>2011</strong> - honorary statue is erected in his old faculty.</li>
